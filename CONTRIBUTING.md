# Contributing to osd
If you would like to contribute to this project please read the details below

# 1. Codebase
Please make sure that your code is readable, and efficient. And all files made are to be put into folders that help with the organisation of the project.

# 2. Packages
If you need to install a package for your idea or solution, feel free to install it. However, after you install it, you need to update the requirements.txt by running
```sh
py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 3. Pull Requests
Like what you would expect, I would go through all of the code changes in each pull request. If I like it, it will go through, if it doesnt, or there is a better way to do it, I wont go through with it, however, I will also give feedback and ask questions about the request and the changes made, to make sure that it is the best for the community.

# 4. Task Board
There will be a task board open for everybody to see. It will contain all of the stuff for what to do is this project, making sure that everybody knows what they are doing.

# 5. Tests
There is a test runner file called run_tests.py. All you need to do is make sure that all of the files you would like to test and the functions needed to test are put into the tests/ folder and organised nicely. The test framework that osd uses is Pytest so for the run_tests.py to work, Pytest needs to find those files. There is also a build workflow that will also go through and double check if the build works or fails.
