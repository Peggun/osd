# osd (Open-Source Data)
As a programmer myself, I have noticed when training AI's, I have to scour the internet for a file size that fits my recommended size. But here at osd, you can have all sorts of data, for free anywhere to use. This is the Australian version, and I plan to introduce different countries to this project. osd has everything, from books, to datasets, to wiki pages.
